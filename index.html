            <h2> A tad bit about me </h2>
            <br>
            <p> I've been programming properly since 2020 and the pandemic and over that time, I've done quite a bit to be fair. I learned how to use Python (woo, python, yeah) through Computer Science in school and then also tutorials online. 
            <br>The only reason I started programming was a Discord Bot looked cool so I wanted to make one. Looked into JS, too hard, swapped to Python. Easy as.</p>

                    <li>The Zookeeper - A Discord Bot which sends animal pics on command.</li>
                    <li>Otter Pics API - An API (barely) which sends a random photo of an otter.</li>
                </ul>
